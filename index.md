## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

1. Lab 6
Lab 6 was one of my favorite labs because of the blackjack game especially. I’ve played the actual card game but it was fun learning about how to actually play it in lecture and then coding the actual game. Although it was a bit tedious inputting all the numbers , it was a lot of copy and pasting. What the lab taught me was how to validate input using vectors to store command line arguments.

2. Lab 8
I liked lab-8 because of the 2 player game code. It was especially interesting realizing that this is nothing compared to what actual game developers actually have to do. I liked how one program was for us to write a secret to a file and the other was reading it without showing the answer. I learned how to catch the file errors I came upon and to work with input streams.

3. Lab 9
I also liked Lab-9 because it felt like making a real spell checker tool that almost every college student uses on a day to day basis like the one on google docs. One of the parts that I stumbled on was getting the program to correctly check each document word from the dictionary, especially since punctuation made some of the words  look like they were spelled wrong when they weren't.
